# SpaceX First Stage Landing Prediction

This project's main aim is to predict the success of SpaceX's first stage landing based on various factors such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits. The project involves data collection from SpaceX Rest API and Wikipedia, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, interactive visual analytics, and predictive analysis using classification models.

The project is divided into the following parts:

1. Data Collection: Collect data from SpaceX API and Wikipedia
2. Data Wrangling: Clean and preprocess the data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the data and visualize the relationships between variables
4. Interactive Visual Analytics: Create interactive visualizations using Plotly
5. Predictive Analysis: Model Training, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Model Evaluation and Deployment

The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The libraries used in this project include Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, and Folium.
